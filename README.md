### Introduction

The main activity for this assignment is to see how people find information about drugs and medicine. The basic need involved is safety because it involves the health and well-being of people. People get information from advertsiements, books, newspapers, magazines, television, and also seek help from medical professinals. More specifically for this study, we are looking at how people find this information through the internet. There is currently a lot of information online, but it isn't always trustworthy. I think the implementation of a accurately currated, organized, online database would be very useful to the users.

Users can be anyone, as we all might need to take medicine at some point. But people who do this activity are more likely people who are sick or more prone to getting sick. Young adults who are starting to independently care for their health and the eldery who might have deterioring health would also do this activity. It can be done anyware, as long as there is an internet connected device to allow the user to find information.

We will be conducting an interview with participatory observation as our research method.
