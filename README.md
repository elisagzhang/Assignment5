### Introduction

The main activity for this assignment is to see how people find information about drugs and medicine. The basic need involved is safety because it involves the health and well-being of people. People get information from advertsiements, books, newspapers, magazines, television, and also seek help from medical professinals. More specifically for this study, we are looking at how people find this information through the internet. There is currently a lot of information online, but it isn't always trustworthy. I think the implementation of a accurately currated, organized, online database would be very useful to the users.

Users can be anyone, as we all might need to take medicine at some point. But people who do this activity are more likely people who are sick or more prone to getting sick. Young adults who are starting to independently care for their health and the eldery who might have deterioring health would also do this activity. It can be done anyware, as long as there is an internet connected device to allow the user to find information.

We will be conducting an interview with participatory observation as our research method.

### Interview Transcript

### Reflection

I think that I was a little confused as to what to do when I was creating the script, so my script was a little messy. I tend to have expectations as to what the interviewee will respond to prompts. So sometimes when the interviewee doesn't act or do what I expect, I get a little thrown off and confused. I think the broadness of the prompts led to some unexpected responses. Another thing is that I kind of jumped around with the questions and sometimes forgot about some questions, so next time I want to be more orderly about how I ask the questions. I really liked that my interviewee was very vocal about what she was doing and I think that I was better at prompting them to do things verbally.
